They have infinite attempts and can take as much time as they want. This is for the users to learn more about binary and understand how it works, not just get a 100%. The understanding of binary knowledge could again help them further in our group's mini arcade. There could possibly a pre-test and a post-test. The pre-test will be easier as ig will introduce the users to binary, but the post test could potentially test their binary skills after doing the pre test and going through our whole binary arcade. This will also encourage the user to focus and understand, so they can ace the pre and post test!"
