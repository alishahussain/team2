    "(IOC-1.C.1 + IOC-1.C.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Socioeconomic Variation: Access to the Internet is not uniform across economic status groups. Individuals with higher socioeconomic status may have better access to the internet compared to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demographic Variation: Internet access can differ based on demographic factors such as age, education level, and occupation. Younger, more educated individuals might have better or easier access compared to older individuals or those with a lower education.\n",

    "* International Disparities: Developed nations often have widespread internet infrastructure compared to developing or underdeveloped countries. Countries with mountainous or other rough terrain might have difficulties providing internet. Additionally, urban areas generally have better internet infrastructure than rural areas. Remote or underdeveloped regions may face challenges in accessing the internet."

    "* Access Challenges: Limited access to the internet and digital devices raises concerns about fair and equal opportunities for education, employment, healthcare, and social participation in our modern societies. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Influence Considerations: The divide extends beyond mere access, impacting the ability of individuals or groups to influence and engage in the increasingly digital world. As this technology develops more quickly, those without access are left behind faster. Students without internet access fall behind their peers in school. Then, as other students keep learning, it becomes harder and harder to catch up.\n",

Actions such as purchasing digital devices or subscribing to internet services may indirectly be contributing to its growth.\n",
