    "In essence, the digital divide is the gap between those who have access to modern information and communication technology (ICT) resources, such as the internet and digital devices, and those who do not. This gap can exist on various levels, including access to hardware and infrastructure, internet connectivity, digital skills, and the ability to use and benefit from digital technologies. The digital divide can contribute to social and economic inequalities, limiting opportunities for those who are digitally marginalized and hindering their ability to participate fully in the increasingly digitalized world. \n",

    "Efforts to bridge the digital divide often involve initiatives to improve infrastructure, provide affordable access, and enhance digital literacy skills.\n"
