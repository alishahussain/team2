- Dante and Aswhin: 0.95/1 
    - I loved the plans and the usage of the RGB selector and customizer and AI usage. I also loved the interactive features. Can improve with more customization 
- Lincoln and Gurshawn: 0.94/1 
    - I loved your plans for a text to color converter. This feature was fun to use and the effort put in was great. There was a slight lack of plans but it was still great. Could be improved with more tangible code.
