[Binary Puzzle Game](https://alishahussain.github.io/team2//b-g)

>- This is a javascript binary puzzle game
>- The game consists of two different puzzles displayed on one screen
>- The goal of the binary puzzle is to toggle the bits on the left to equal the number displayed on the right
>- The goal of the decimal puzzle is to click the question mark and use the number pad to input an integer (decimal) that equals the binary number displayed on the left
>- In case the user still doesn't fully figure out how binary works there is an "Extra" link that leads the user to a helpful website that explains vital informatin about binary. 
>- The goal of the game is to clear out the board (solve the puzzles) before they all stack. Once the user is running out of time the board with the puzzles will light up in different colors signaling that the game is about to end. If it does, a "game over" sign will be displayed. 
>- Game can be paused any time when it is necessitated. 
>- There are multiple levels in this game, each one harder than the other in addition to the amount of lines. 
>- There is also a scoring system, 100 points per puzzle and an extra 250 for clearing the board.

>- Player is able to end game when needed. 
>- At the end of the day the game helps the player figure out how binary works and how it is closely related to math.
