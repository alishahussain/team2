>### How does binary work? 
>- The binary system is a way of representing data using 0s and 1s. This system is used by computers to represent all the data it works with. To compute a number in this system, you would multiply the digit value by the place value, then add them all together.

>### How to convert binary to decimal:

>- Step 1: Write the binary number and count the powers of 2 from right to left (starting from 0).
<br><br>

>- Step 2: Write each binary digit(right to left) with corresponding powers of 2 from right to left, such that MSB or the first binary digit will be multiplied by the greatest power of 2.
<br><br>

>- Step 3: Add all the products in the step 2
<br><br>

>- Step 4: The answer is our decimal number.

>#### Here are some examples:

>- Binary is represented in (xxxx)2 and decimal in (xxxx)10 format.

<br><br>

>- Binary numbers are read by separating them into separate digits. Each digit in binary is represented using 0 and 1 and they are the powers of 2 starting from left hand side and then the power is gradually increased from 0 to (n-1).

>### How to convert decimal to binary: 

>- Step 1: Divide the given decimal number by 2, and find the remainder (Ri).
<br><br>

>- Step 2: Now divide the quotient (Qi) that is obtained in the above step by 2, and find the remainder.
<br><br>

>- Step 3: Repeat the above steps 1 and 2, until 0 is obtained as a quotient.
<br><br>

>- Step 4: Write down the remainder in the following manner: the last remainder is written first, followed by the rest in the reverse order (Rn, R(n – 1) …. R1). thus binary conversion of the given decimal number will be obtained.

>- The number system that has a base value of 10 is called Decimal Number System. Decimal Numbers are consist of the following digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

<br><br>

>- All the decimal numbers have their corresponding binary numbers. These binary numbers are used in computer applications and used for programming or coding purposes. This is because binary digits, 0 and 1 are only understood by computers.
