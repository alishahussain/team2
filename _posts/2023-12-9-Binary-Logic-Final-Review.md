## Painter Game

The binary painter game is a project that I developed to provide users with an engaging platform for creating pixel art while learning binary logic. Users can easily manipulate RGB values using sliders and even input custom binary codes for precise color selection. Changng values on the sliders simultaneously changes the binary value of the color, showing the users how binary logic applies to color values. By clicking on the grid, users can fill pixels with their chosen colorsI decided to promote a creative way of learning, so that everyone can have fun while expirementing and understanding binary colors. At the beginning of this project, I was unsure of binary logic, but now I can understand how the numbers change, and how to manually do it as well. An issue I encountered was figuring out how to make the game educational, and getting the user to actually understand binary logic. I decided to use sliders to have a visual concept of the colors changing. If I had more time, I would make a color by number game, where the binary values are shownn in each grid, and the user has to select the color tha would be made. This should

## Memory Game

<<<<<<< HEAD
The binary memory game is the feature I focused on for the past couple of weeks. The purpose of the game is for the player to get familier with using the binary numbers and its decimals. The video below goes through the structures, key details of the game, the purpose again. As for making the game, I ran into some issues, This biggest issue I ran into was getting the cards to match up properly. This took a lot of trial and error, I would change things and test it and change more things and test that. The specific parts of the code that I focused on was in the javascript, and it was the functions that releated to card interactions. Another issue I faced was creating 3 gameboards that would work simultaneously. I was sucessfully creating one gamerboard, though I wanted there to be different levels of diffuculty for the player. I had to adjust the CSS to make the actual gameboards apppear, and I adjusted them by increasing the number of cards, then I added sperate elements/variables in the HTML for the different gameboards, and lastly I had seperate fuctions that initalize the gameboards in the javascript section of the code. One thing that went well from the start was the style

## Binary Knowledge Quiz 

The binary knowldege quiz is a quiz that I created and focused on for these past few weeks. The purpose of this quiz is to test the user's knowledge about binary. This quiz is supposed to be taken after using our guides, using our converters, and playing our games. This will help the user finalize their learning about binary as they can tale this quiz as many times as they want. This quiz includes 3 multiple choice options, with 15 questions which include advanced and simple questions and information about binary. Users should take this quiz until they get atleast an 80% (12/15). At the beginning of my development, I ran into issues changing the theme of the quiz, but now I changed it into have a sleek green theme. I also had issues with conducting binary experiments but now I understand it all. I had some up and downs from the start, the up being having a valid selection of questions and answers to input into the JavaScript quiz. I had issues with the styling and the quiz not working itself, but the questions and answers was what went correct from the beginning. Overall, the issues had me struggling for a bit, but using collaboration and team skills, I figured it out.

## Binary Alphabetic Translator Game and Guide

I created the my binary game and its instructions to teach the user how to translate english to binary and vice-versa, it uses a database of words and gives the user a word in english or binary to translate. The provided video will display how the game functions and some of its primary features in more depth. Users should play this game until they can consistantly get atleast 3-5 score before getting three strikes and having to restart. In the creation of the game I ran into many issues. The first of which came with the most fundemental part of the game, I couldn't get the program to record the correct answers, the program was only recording strikes. After many instances of the program, I got that part of the program to work. However, since the program relied on randomization to give the user prompts, I would sometimes get the same word twice. When this was fixed I worked on getting the program to use english to binary instead of just binary to english and this caused all of my previous work on making two identical things not following eachother to not function. My team and I worked effectively together, with each member successfully completing their assigned tasks as anticipated. We would often help eachother in our different projects to the best extent we could when one of us got stuck.

### [Binary Puzzle Game and Guide](https://youtu.be/j0T-oaZraf0)

[Binary Puzzle Game and Guide](https://youtu.be/j0T-oaZraf0)

For the arcade I created an introductory binary guide that helps students understand the fundamentals of binary. In addition to the guide, I added converter games where the player inputs a decimal or binary number to convert it and potentially learn and memorize the way binary works. I also decided to add a hexadecimal guide since it's another important aspect of binary. One of the converters I created was a converter that included binary, decimals, and hexadecimal conversions. Once the students gets more comfortable with binary I decided it would be a great idea to create two guessing games, one for binary and one for decimals. If the player inputs an incorrect answer, the game makes sure you provide with the right answer to the question. These games help the player not only learn more about binary, but help understand the way it functions. This leads to the last and final binary puzzle game. This is by far the most interactive game which includes instructions, multiple levels that vary in difficulty, and a scoreboard. A cool concept in this game is that the player can run out of time; being able to calculate the conversions fast is really good when using binary, this game helps strengthen those binary skills and have fun at the same time!
However, throughout the development of these game I struggled many issues such as the scaling of the games was messing up the menu bar, or the guessing games didn't work as expected whereas it was asking a decimal and expecting a decimal for the answer. I progressed through these games a lot, for example the guessing games didn't have the option to generate a new mumber. If I had more time I would add a hexadecimal guessing game and add more puzzles to the binary puzzle. I think my team and I collaborated well and everyone did their task as far as expected, which was something that calmed me down. Obviously, my games focus on binary math and its fundamentals.
