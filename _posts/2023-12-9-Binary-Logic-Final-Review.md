# Binary Logic: Arcade 
# Review Ticket

## Painter Game

The binary painter game is a project that I developed to provide users with an engaging platform for creating pixel art while learning binary logic. Users can easily manipulate RGB values using sliders and even input custom binary codes for precise color selection. Changng values on the sliders simultaneously changes the binary value of the color, showing the users how binary logic applies to color values. By clicking on the grid, users can fill pixels with their chosen colorsI decided to promote a creative way of learning, so that everyone can have fun while expirementing and understanding binary colors. At the beginning of this project, I was unsure of binary logic, but now I can understand how the numbers change, and how to manually do it as well.

The binary memory game is the feature I focused on for the past couple of weeks. The purpose of the game is for the player to get familier with using the binary numbers and its decimals. The video below goes through the structures, key details of the game, the purpose again. As for making the game, I ran into some issues, This biggest issue I ran into was getting the cards to match up properly. This took a lot of trial and error, I would change things and test it and change more things and test that. The specific parts of the code that I focused on was in the javascript, and it was the functions that releated to card interactions. Another issue I faced was creating 3 gameboards that would work simultaneously. I was sucessfully creating one gamerboard, though I wanted there to be different levels of diffuculty for the player. I had to adjust the CSS to make the actual gameboards apppear, and I adjusted them by increasing the number of cards, then I added sperate elements/variables in the HTML for the different gameboards, and lastly I had seperate fuctions that initalize the gameboards in the javascript section of the code. One thing that went well from the start was the style
